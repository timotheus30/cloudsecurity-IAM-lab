# Cloud IAM Lab Documentation

## Lab Objective
Implement cloud identity and access management in Microsoft Entra ID focusing on security best practices and auditability.

## Environment Setup
- Azure Free Account  
- Microsoft Entra ID Free tier  
- Microsoft Authenticator App  

## Steps Performed
1. Created Entra ID tenant and users  
2. Created security groups and assigned users  
3. Created resource group and configured RBAC  
4. Tested user lifecycle: joiner, mover, leaver  
5. Verified audit logs and MFA authentication

## Results / Observations
- Audit logs captured all administrative actions  
- RBAC enforced least-privilege access  
- MFA confirmed using Microsoft Authenticator App  
- No Conditional Access policies used (Free tier limitation)

## Lessons Learned
- Azure Entra ID Free tier supports foundational IAM  
- RBAC and audit logs provide strong security governance  
- MFA testing strengthens understanding of cloud authentication
